This became readily apparent today as the infrastructure giant suffered one of its most severe outages in recent history. Everything from social media apps to publishing platforms went down. Many still are, late into the evening.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin and nostr carry on unimpeded. Centralizing forces tend to centralize further. So expect this trend to accelerate. Fast forward: decentralization goes from a novel curiosity to a critical foundation.

There's more to dig into.

How to measure the impact of this scale of outage? What degree of pain will motivate builders to evaluate decentralized alternatives?
