This is my workshop. A place for notes, half-formed ideas, and thinking in public. Finished essays are at [shawnyeager.com](https://shawnyeager.com).

### Why Two Sites?

**shawnyeager.org** — The workshop. Rough notes, explorations, and building in public.

**shawnyeager.com** — The gallery. Finished work.

Most thinking happens in private notebooks. This is mine, made public. The workshop feeds the gallery. Not everything needs to graduate.

### What's Here?

- Notes and observations
- Questions I'm wrestling with
- Half-formed ideas being explored
- Concepts I'm working through

### Not Indexed

This site is public but intentionally blocked from search engines. You can share the link with anyone, but it won't appear in Google searches. This creates space to explore ideas freely.

### Following Along
