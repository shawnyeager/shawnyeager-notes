Bitcoin is designed to minimize trust. That's the whole point â€” trustless, permissionless, decentralized.

But selling Bitcoin solutions requires building enormous amounts of trust.

You're asking companies to reconsider their entire monetary infrastructure. To custody assets in ways that feel uncomfortable. To adopt technology that their compliance team is nervous about. To work with startups instead of established vendors.

This paradox creates interesting challenges for go-to-market strategy. You can't just run traditional enterprise sales plays. The technology says "don't trust us" but successful adoption requires deep trust relationships.

The companies that navigate this well do a few things:
- Lead with education, not product
- Build genuine expertise and credibility
- Create clear security frameworks
- Partner with complementary providers
- Focus on long-term relationships over quick wins

This connects to my thoughts on Bitcoin sales cycles and why traditional SaaS metrics don't apply.

More to explore here about the nature of trust in systems designed to eliminate it.
