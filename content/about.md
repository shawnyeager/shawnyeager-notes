This is my workshop. A place for notes, half-formed ideas, and thinking in public. Finished essays are at [shawnyeager.com](https://shawnyeager.com).

## Why two sites?

**notes.shawnyeager.com** --- The workshop. Rough notes, explorations, and thinking in public.

**shawnyeager.com** --- The gallery. Finished work.

Most thinking happens in private notebooks. This is mine, made public. The workshop feeds the gallery. Not everything needs to graduate.

## What's here?

- Notes and observations
- Questions I'm wrestling with
- Half-formed ideas being explored
- Concepts I'm working through
